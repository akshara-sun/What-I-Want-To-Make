# What-I-Want-To-Make

I am completely new to programming and am keen on learning more so I created a list of small projects I'd like to make. These will help document my progress and if you are a beginner like me, then you can join in on the quest as well :) Along the way, I'll make sure to update when each of these were completed and of course, the list will grow as I continue to grow as well.
